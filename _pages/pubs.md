## ADNI (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/)

The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is a longitudinal multicenter study designed to develop clinical, imaging, genetic, and biochemical biomarkers for the early detection and tracking of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since its launch more than a decade ago, the landmark public-private partnership has made major contributions to AD research, enabling the sharing of data between researchers around the world.

Three overarching goals of the ADNI study are:
To detect AD at the earliest possible stage (pre-dementia) and identify ways to track the disease's progression with biomarkers.
To support advances in AD intervention, prevention, and treatment through the application of new diagnostic methods at the earliest possible stages (when intervention may be most effective).
To continually administer ADNI's innovative data-access policy, which provides all data without embargo to all scientists in the world.

## OpenfMRI(http://openfmri.org/)

The OpenfMRI project is managed by the Poldrack Lab and Center for Reproducible Neuroscience at Stanford University, with computing resources provided by the Texas Advanced Computing Center and Amazon.com . It is funded by grants from the National Science Foundation, National Institute for Drug Abuse, and Laura and John Arnold Foundation.

## NDAR data(https://nda.nih.gov/)

The National Institute of Mental Health Data Archive (NDA) makes available human subjects data collected from hundreds of research projects across many scientific domains. NDA provides infrastructure for sharing research data, tools, methods, and analyses enabling collaborative science and discovery. De-identified human subjects data, harmonized to a common standard, are available to qualified researchers.  Summary data are available to all.

The NDA mission is to accelerate scientific research and discovery through data sharing, data harmonization, and the reporting of research results.

## INDI data(http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/)

The International Neuroimaging Data-sharing Initiative (INDI) and 1000 Functional Connectomes Project (FCP).This bucket contains multiple neuroimaging datasets that are part of the International Neuroimaging Data-Sharing Initiative. Raw human and non-human primate neuroimaging data include 1) Structural MRI; 2) Functional MRI; 3) Diffusion Tensor Imaging; 4) Electroencephalogram (EEG) In addition to the raw data, preprocessed data is also included for some datasets. A complete list of the available datasets can be seen in the documentation lonk provided below.Each dataset within INDI has its own release schedule. See release date and frequency for [each dataset](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/IndiPro.html)

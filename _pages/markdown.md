## Statistical Parametric Mapping

Introduction
Statistical Parametric Mapping refers to the construction and assessment of spatially extended statistical processes used to test hypotheses about functional imaging data. These ideas have been instantiated in a free and open source software that is called SPM.

The SPM software package has been designed for the analysis of brain imaging data sequences. The sequences can be a series of images from different cohorts, or time-series from the same subject. The current release is designed for the analysis of fMRI, PET, SPECT, EEG and MEG.

## FMRIB Software Library v6.0

FSL is a comprehensive library of analysis tools for FMRI, MRI and DTI brain imaging data. It runs on Apple and PCs (both Linux, and Windows via a Virtual Machine), and is very easy to install. Most of the tools can be run both from the command line and as GUIs ("point-and-click" graphical user interfaces). 

## FreeSurfer Software Suite
An open source software suite for processing and analyzing (human) brain MRI images.

## AFNI
AFNI is a set of C programs for processing, analyzing, and displaying functional MRI (FMRI) data - a technique for mapping human brain activity. It runs on Unix+X11+Motif systems, including SGI, Solaris, Linux, and Mac OS X. It is available free (in C source code format, and some precompiled binaries) for research purposes.

## DPABI: a toolbox for Data Processing & Analysis for Brain Imaging
DPABI is a GNU/GPL* toolbox for Data Processing & Analysis of Brain Imaging, evolved from DPARSF (Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI) and contains DPABISurf and BrainImageNet. Please refer to The R-fMRI Course to know more about how to use this toolbox. Add with subfolders for DPABI in MATLAB's path setting and enter "dpabi" in the command window to enjoy this powerful toolbox.

Welcome to the Pattern Recognition and NeuroImage Analysis（PRNA）Lab at the Nanjing University of finance and Economics.

Our Pattern Recognition and NeuroImage Analysis（PRNA）Lab mainly focuses on the discovery of fundamental principles of brain structural and functional architectures and their relationship, via brain imaging, computational modeling and machine learning methods. We are interested in the interaction between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Human Intelligence (HI): Using Deep Learning to facilitate the analysis and interpretation of brain data; Applying neuroscience knowledge to design more efficient Deep Learning architectures. We also have strong interests in applying the discovered principles, theories and methods to better understand neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders including Autism, Alzheimer’s disease, and Major Depression, among other brain conditions.

We take an interdisciplinary approach in our research and benefit significantly from our collaborators. The PRNA is affiliated with the NUFE Department of College of Information Engineering, Bioimaging Research Center andd Institute of Bioinformatics.

We welcome you to browse the four themes of our current research projects, publications, and people who are involved in our research.
